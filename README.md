# disaster-and-risk-management-spatial-analysis
In light of the recommendations on Emergency Planning and Response, the State Government has contracted your consultancy to perform a risk analysis across the state. Your consultancy will be required to gather state-wide data related to the disaster scenario and its effect on the population, environment, industry, and infrastructure. Based on this data, the state government wants your consultancy to produce a response plan for emergency response teams and the general public. This response plan will prepare the target audiences for future disaster events.
